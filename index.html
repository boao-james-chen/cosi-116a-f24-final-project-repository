    <h1>Project Team 19: Public Transportation, housing, and population, COSI 116A F24</h1>

    <p><strong>Peter Williams</strong>, <strong>Kaiyan Xu</strong>, <strong>Xiaoran Liu</strong>, <strong>James
        Chen</strong></p>

    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a
        href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis
        University</a>.</p>

    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p>As students at Brandeis University, located in the Greater Boston Area, we frequently rely on the MBTA system for
      transportation across the city and its surrounding suburbs. However, we’ve observed that Waltham, the city where
      Brandeis is located—despite being only nine miles from Downtown Boston—is significantly underserved by the MBTA.
      Unlike nearby cities such as Newton and Braintree, which are even farther from downtown but enjoy consistent T
      services, Waltham lacks any direct T lines. This disparity inspired us to examine the factors that affect MBTA
      service quality and accessibility.</p>

    <p>Some key factors to explore include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Population density: More people, more demand for public transportation.</li>
      <li>Distance from downtown: Closer to downtown, more likely to have MBTA services.</li>
      <li><strong>Socioeconomic status:</strong> Neighborhoods with higher income levels may have more resources to
        advocate for transportation improvements, while lower-income areas might face greater transportation challenges.
      </li>
      <li>Demographics: Age, occupation, and other demographic factors can influence public transportation usage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, presence of consistent T services also influences those qualities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Housing prices: Areas near T stations tend to have higher housing costs due to their added convenience.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Expectation:</em></p>

    <p>Our project investigates the correlations between public transportation availability and population and housing
      characteristics in Boston. Specifically, we aim to explore relationships between various aspects of the MBTA
      system (e.g., number of stations/MBTA services available in each neighborhood, average daily ridership, and
      station/line quality) and population-related factors (e.g., population density, demographics, and average monthly
      rent).
    </p>

    <p><strong>For Residents and Prospective Movers:</strong><br>
      It will provide a tool to help people living in or considering moving to Boston make informed decisions about
      where to live. Users will gain insights into the quality and accessibility of public transportation in different
      neighborhoods, helping them weigh factors such as convenience, cost, and connectivity.</p>

    <p><strong>For Urban Planners and Policy Makers:</strong><br>
      The tool will enable administrators to identify which neighborhoods are well-served by public transportation and
      which are underserved. These insights could guide decisions about future MBTA expansion or improvements.</p>

        <h2>MBTA Rapid Transit ("T") Map</h2>
        <img src="images/mbta_map.png" alt="MBTA Map">
        <p>A simple map showing all existing MBTA rapid transit lines (also called "T") serving the Boston Area. Hovering above stations allows the user to view the lines and municipality (or neighborhood) the station belongs to. Stations serviced by multiple different lines are colored gray. This map provides a quick overview of the T system in Boston, helping users understand the distribution of transit lines across the city. </p>

        <p>Notably, some lines, especially the "Green" line, share a same track, so they are named and represented as branches from the same line on the map.</p>

        <p>In total, there are 125 stations and 8 MBTA lines shown on the map, grouped here according to their branches:</p>

        <table id="line-colors-table">
          <tr><td><span>Red</span>, <span>Mattapan</span></td></tr>
          <tr><td><span>Orange</span></td></tr>
          <tr><td><span>Green-B</span>, <span>Green-C</span>, <span>Green-D</span>, <span>Green-E</span></td></tr>
          <tr><td><span>Blue</span></td></tr>
        </table>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Table</h2>
        <img src="images/neighborhood-lines-table.png" alt="Neighborhoods/Lines Table"">
        <p>The table is designed to be an easy way for users to find information on a particular neighborhood/city or line of the T that they are interested in. With its simple alphabetical organization, users can easily find a city by its name to select and highlight all of the stations along the lines that run through that neighborhood. Likewise, if they are interested in observing patterns along a whole line through different neighborhoods, they can select a line instead.</p>

        <p>When a user selects a column or row, each cell in that line will highlight in light blue, chosen as a widely accessible color that aligns with the heatmap color scheme. When an individual cell is selected, it is highlighted a slightly darker blue than the column and row and the text is bolded so that the eye is drawn to that cell. After any selection on the table, the corresponding line or stations in that neighborhood are highlighted in the map view. The heatmap also updates with new values whenever a neighborhood is selected.</p>

        <p>In addition to being a simple way to interact with and select parts of the visualization that the user is interested in, the table also implicitly encodes information about how well each neighborhood is served by public transportation. Since each cell adapts to the text inside it, the size of the cell indirectly correlates with how well-served an area is by the T. For example, Brookline has a high number of stops along the C branch of the Green Line, which increases the size of the cell, making it stand out compared to nearby neighborhoods with significantly fewer stations, such as Braintree. And because there is more text inside certain cells, they have a higher weight and contrast themselves with the empty cells nearby. Downtown is a good example of this, since it has a significant number of stations spread out across each line, instead of being a large number of stations on one line.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Correlation Analysis Heatmap</h2>
        <img src="images/correlation_matrix.png" alt="Correlation Matrix">
        <p>Our correlation analysis tool is designed with clarity and user engagement in mind. At the top, users first
          see the neighborhood name and two intuitive filter buttons that help highlight important patterns - high
          correlations (≥0.7) and low correlations (≤0.2). These filters allow users to quickly identify the strongest
          and weakest relationships between variables.</p>

        <p>The central heatmap uses a soft blue color gradient that increases in intensity with stronger correlations.
          We chose blue because it's widely accessible for colorblind users and creates a professional, trustworthy
          feel. Each cell displays both color and the actual correlation value for precision. When users hover over any
          cell, a tooltip appears showing the exact relationship between variables (for example, "Transit Lines ×
          Population, Correlation: 0.990"). This interactive feature helps users explore specific relationships they're
          interested in.</p>
        <p>To aid understanding, we placed a variable explanation panel directly next to the heatmap. This side-by-side
          layout ensures users can easily reference variable definitions while exploring correlations. The panel
          includes both straightforward descriptions of each variable and practical interpretations of what the values
          mean for the neighborhood. We also included a "Understanding Correlation Values" guide that breaks down how to
          interpret different correlation strengths, using plain language rather than statistical jargon.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Interactive Features and Linking</h2>
        <p>The visualization is dynamically linked to each other - when users click on different station on the map, it
          will highlight the neighborhoods in the table, and the heatmap instantly updates to show that neighborhood's
          specific correlation patterns. This linking creates a seamless exploration experience, allowing users to
          quickly glimpse across different areas of the city. However, brushing is not provided as the data could be meaningless, if the user chooses to select multiple disconnected stations from different lines at once.</p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>
    <p>
      The task table outlines a series of domain-specific questions related to public transportation, housing, and
      population density within the Boston area. We aim to explore key relationships and comparisons within the data,
      focusing on transportation accessibility, housing quality, rent prices, and population distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ultimate goal is to derive meaningful insights about transportation infrastructure and housing dynamics. For
      example, identifying areas with balanced accessibility, understanding relationships between housing density and
      transportation options, and exploring disparities in public transit coverage.

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    <h2>Initial Sketches</h2>
    <p>
      The design process began with rough sketches to outline the basic structure of the visualization. We chose the
      following three sketches in the initial phase:
    </p>
    <div class="image-gallery">
      <img src="files/sketch1.png" alt="Initial Sketch 1">
      <img src="files/sketch2.png" alt="Initial Sketch 2">
      <img src="files/sketch3.png" alt="Initial Sketch 3">
    </div>

    <h2>Final sketch</h2>
    <img class="full-text-width-img" src="files/final_sketch.png" alt="Final Sketch">
    <p>The final design blends thoughtful visualization principles with an engaging, user-friendly experience to help people explore Boston’s housing and transportation dynamics. At its core is an interactive map that displays MBTA ridership, color-coded by metro lines, making patterns immediately visible.  Inspired by Shneiderman’s mantra of “overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand,” we included a dropdown menu that lets users choose specific station/neighborhood, we enables linking and brushing to other visualizations, giving them the freedom to start broad and then dive deeper based on their interests.

    Next to the map, an interactive table makes it easy to see city-specific details while keeping the connection to the map clear. Hovering over rows (cities) or columns (metro lines) highlights the relevant areas on the map, helping users naturally link the data to the city’s layout. To add further depth, a heat map uncovers relationships between housing, population density, and transit access, turning complex data into clear, actionable insights. This design isn’t just about showing numbers—it’s about helping users discover meaningful patterns in a way that feels natural, intuitive, and visually engaging. </p>

    <h2>Usability Testing and Feedback</h2>
    <p>
    The reviewers found our data visualization engaging and interactive but noted that its purpose and functionality are not immediately clear, requiring users time to understand. Specific areas for improvement include clarifying the x and y axes on the heatmap and refining the color scheme for better accessibility. To address this feedback, we plan to add annotations to the heatmap to clearly explain axis meanings and data relationships. By enhancing clarity with annotations and improving user-friendliness overall, the visualization will become more intuitive, effective, and accessible for all users.
    </p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>Our team succeeded in developing an interactive visualization system that explores the connections between MBTA transportation services and demographic factors across Boston neighborhoods. The project brought together three key components: an interactive MBTA ridership map, a heatmap showing correlations between transit access and socioeconomic factors, and a detailed table with neighborhood-specific metrics. These tools are interconnected through linking and brushing features, allowing users to seamlessly explore relationships between transportation access, housing costs, and demographic trends.</p>

    <p>While we achieved our core goals, there’s room to make the system even more insightful. Incorporating chronological data could reveal how these patterns change over time, offering a richer perspective beyond the current static snapshot. The correlation analysis would also benefit from <em>more granular community-level data</em>, as neighborhood-wide averages show limited variation. Additionally, integrating accurate GIS data would allow us to color-code precise neighborhood boundaries. Looking ahead, this project provides a strong foundation for further exploration. Future directions include integrating real-time MBTA service data, allowing users to observe how delays or changes impact neighborhoods in real-time. Expanding the analysis to include additional factors like commute times, air quality, or employment access could uncover new insights into urban living challenges. By refining both the data and visualization components, this system has the potential to become an essential tool for cities striving to create more equitable, accessible, and sustainable communities.</p>
