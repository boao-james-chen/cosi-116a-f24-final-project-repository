    <h1>Project Team 19: Public Transportation, housing, and population, COSI 116A F24</h1>

    <p><strong>Peter Williams</strong>, <strong>Kaiyan Xu</strong>, <strong>Xiaoran Liu</strong>, <strong>James
        Chen</strong></p>

    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a
        href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis
        University</a>.</p>

    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p>As students at Brandeis University, located in the Greater Boston Area, we frequently rely on the MBTA system for
      transportation across the city and its surrounding suburbs. However, we’ve observed that Waltham, the city where
      Brandeis is located—despite being only nine miles from Downtown Boston—is significantly underserved by the MBTA.
      Unlike nearby cities such as Newton and Braintree, which are even farther from downtown but enjoy consistent T
      services, Waltham lacks any direct T lines. This disparity inspired us to examine the factors that affect MBTA
      service quality and accessibility.</p>

    <p>Some key factors to explore include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Population density: More people, more demand for public transportation.</li>
      <li>Distance from downtown: Closer to downtown, more likely to have MBTA services.</li>
      <li><strong>Socioeconomic status:</strong> Neighborhoods with higher income levels may have more resources to advocate for transportation improvements, while lower-income areas might face greater transportation challenges.</li>
      <li>Demographics: Age, occupation, and other demographic factors can influence public transportation usage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, presence of consistent T services also influences those qualities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Housing prices: Areas near T stations tend to have higher housing costs due to their added convenience.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Expectation:</em></p>

    <p>Our project investigates the correlations between public transportation availability and population and housing
      characteristics in Boston. Specifically, we aim to explore relationships between various aspects of the MBTA
      system (e.g., number of stations/MBTA services available in each neighborhood, average daily ridership, and
      station/line quality) and population-related factors (e.g., population density, demographics, and average monthly
      rent).
    </p>

    <p><strong>For Residents and Prospective Movers:</strong><br>
      It will provide a tool to help people living in or considering moving to Boston make informed decisions about
      where to live. Users will gain insights into the quality and accessibility of public transportation in different
      neighborhoods, helping them weigh factors such as convenience, cost, and connectivity.</p>

    <p><strong>For Urban Planners and Policy Makers:</strong><br>
      The tool will enable administrators to identify which neighborhoods are well-served by public transportation and
      which are underserved. These insights could guide decisions about future MBTA expansion or improvements.</p>

    <h1>Demo Video</h1>

    <p><em>Embedded MP4 demo video using the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag. For example, this screen recording Prof. Cody
        Dunne made of Mike Bostock's flexible transitions in D3 slide:</em></p>

    <video controls width="100%">
      <source src="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/shared/d3-flexible-transitions.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is

        instead.</p>
    </video>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

    <p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation
        slides.</em></p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very
        explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>Summary of task table.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and abstract tasks for domain problems.</em>
    </p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>

    <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
        Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
        Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>


    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>Short summary of work completed and areas for improvement/future-work.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Meaningfully wraps up project and has good future directions.</em></p>
