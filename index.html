    <h1>Project Team 19: Public Transportation, housing, and population, COSI 116A F24</h1>

    <p><strong>Peter Williams</strong>, <strong>Kaiyan Xu</strong>, <strong>Xiaoran Liu</strong>, <strong>James
        Chen</strong></p>

    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a
        href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis
        University</a>.</p>

    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p>As students at Brandeis University, located in the Greater Boston Area, we frequently rely on the MBTA system for
      transportation across the city and its surrounding suburbs. However, we’ve observed that Waltham, the city where
      Brandeis is located—despite being only nine miles from Downtown Boston—is significantly underserved by the MBTA.
      Unlike nearby cities such as Newton and Braintree, which are even farther from downtown but enjoy consistent T
      services, Waltham lacks any direct T lines. This disparity inspired us to examine the factors that affect MBTA
      service quality and accessibility.</p>

    <p>Some key factors to explore include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Population density: More people, more demand for public transportation.</li>
      <li>Distance from downtown: Closer to downtown, more likely to have MBTA services.</li>
      <li><strong>Socioeconomic status:</strong> Neighborhoods with higher income levels may have more resources to
        advocate for transportation improvements, while lower-income areas might face greater transportation challenges.
      </li>
      <li>Demographics: Age, occupation, and other demographic factors can influence public transportation usage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, presence of consistent T services also influences those qualities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Housing prices: Areas near T stations tend to have higher housing costs due to their added convenience.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Expectation:</em></p>

    <p>Our project investigates the correlations between public transportation availability and population and housing
      characteristics in Boston. Specifically, we aim to explore relationships between various aspects of the MBTA
      system (e.g., number of stations/MBTA services available in each neighborhood, average daily ridership, and
      station/line quality) and population-related factors (e.g., population density, demographics, and average monthly
      rent).
    </p>

    <p><strong>For Residents and Prospective Movers:</strong><br>
      It will provide a tool to help people living in or considering moving to Boston make informed decisions about
      where to live. Users will gain insights into the quality and accessibility of public transportation in different
      neighborhoods, helping them weigh factors such as convenience, cost, and connectivity.</p>

    <p><strong>For Urban Planners and Policy Makers:</strong><br>
      The tool will enable administrators to identify which neighborhoods are well-served by public transportation and
      which are underserved. These insights could guide decisions about future MBTA expansion or improvements.</p>

      <h2>Correlation Analysis Heatmap</h2>
      <img src="files/correlation_matrix.png" alt="Correlation Matrix" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px;">
      <p>Our correlation analysis tool is designed with clarity and user engagement in mind. At the top, users first
        see the neighborhood name and two intuitive filter buttons that help highlight important patterns - high
        correlations (≥0.7) and low correlations (≤0.2). These filters allow users to quickly identify the strongest
        and weakest relationships between variables.</p>

      <p>The central heatmap uses a soft blue color gradient that increases in intensity with stronger correlations.
        We chose blue because it's widely accessible for colorblind users and creates a professional, trustworthy
        feel. Each cell displays both color and the actual correlation value for precision. When users hover over any
        cell, a tooltip appears showing the exact relationship between variables (for example, "Transit Lines ×
        Population, Correlation: 0.990"). This interactive feature helps users explore specific relationships they're
        interested in.</p>
      <p>To aid understanding, we placed a variable explanation panel directly next to the heatmap. This side-by-side
        layout ensures users can easily reference variable definitions while exploring correlations. The panel
        includes both straightforward descriptions of each variable and practical interpretations of what the values
        mean for the neighborhood. We also included a "Understanding Correlation Values" guide that breaks down how to
        interpret different correlation strengths, using plain language rather than statistical jargon.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Interactive Features and Linking</h2>
      <p>The visualization is dynamically linked to each other - when users click on different station on the map, it
        will highlight the neighborhoods in the table, and the heatmap instantly updates to show that neighborhood's
        specific correlation patterns. This linking creates a seamless exploration experience, allowing users to
        quickly glimpse across different areas of the city. </p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
    <p>Our analysis utilizes two primary datasets and one derived dataset focusing on Boston's neighborhoods, transit
      systems, and demographic information:</p>
    <h3>Boston Neighborhood Populations Dataset</h3>
    <p>Contains 2020 census data for Boston neighborhoods, including detailed demographic breakdowns.</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Data Type</th>
        <th>Variables</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Categorical</td>
        <td>Race (White, Latino, Asian, etc.), Age groups, Field Concept, Type of institution</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Quantitative</td>
        <td>Total Population, Household Population, Household size, Average rent (2019-2021)</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>MBTA Stations Dataset</h3>
    <p>Contains detailed information about MBTA transit stations including their locations and lines from MBTA. We
      gathered the information from MBTA Api and MBTA Ridership Map</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Data Type</th>
        <th>Variables</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Categorical</td>
        <td>Name, Municipality, Line</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Quantitative</td>
        <td>Latitude, Longitude</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h2>Data Preprocessing Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Transit Line Counting:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Manually counted unique transit lines per neighborhood using the MBTA stations dataset</li>
          <li>Created a mapping between stations and neighborhoods</li>
          <li>Verified station locations against neighborhood boundaries</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Demographic Data Processing:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Calculated minority percentage from racial composition data and college housing percentage from
            institutional housing data</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Correlation Analysis:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Generated neighborhood-specific correlation matrices and stored it as JSON</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>
    <p>
      The task table outlines a series of domain-specific questions related to public transportation, housing, and
      population density within the Boston area. We aim to explore key relationships and comparisons within the data,
      focusing on transportation accessibility, housing quality, rent prices, and population distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ultimate goal is to derive meaningful insights about transportation infrastructure and housing dynamics. For
      example, identifying areas with balanced accessibility, understanding relationships between housing density and
      transportation options, and exploring disparities in public transit coverage.
