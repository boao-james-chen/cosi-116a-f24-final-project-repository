    <h1>Project Team 19: Public Transportation, housing, and population, COSI 116A F24</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Peter Williams</strong>, <strong>Kaiyan Xu</strong>, <strong>Xiaoran Liu</strong>, <strong>James Chen</strong></p>
    
    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p>As Brandeis University is located in the Boston Area, we often have to take the MBTA subway (called "T") to get around the city and its suburbs. However, we often feel that the city Brandeis is in, Waltham, 9 miles from Downtown Boston, is underserved by MBTA: there are no T lines going in Waltham, while nearby Newton and Braintree, both even farther away from downtown, get some consistent T services. This is why we choose to look at the factors affecting MBTA service qualities.</p>

    <p>Some obvious factors include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Population density: more people, more demand for public transportation.</li>
      <li>Distance from downtown: closer to downtown, more likely to have T services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, presence of consistent T services also influences those qualities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Housing prices: areas near T stations are often priced higher, as they provide more convenience.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><em>Expectation:</em></p>

    <p>Our project is about correlations between public transportation and the population in Boston. This means that we are exploring the relationship between different aspects of the public transportation system here (focusing primarily on the T) - including number of stations within each neighborhood, average daily ridership, and quality of a station/line - and facts about the population - including population density, demographics, and average monthly rent. This should result in a tool that can be useful to people living in or considering moving to Boston as they consider where they want to live and how good the public transportation is in each neighborhood. It also would be valuable for administrators to see which neighborhoods seem to be adequately served by public transportation, and which are underserved and could use more or higher quality public transportation. Our visualization will address those needs by creating interactive methods of viewing these relationships in tabular formats so that people can view relationships by line or by neighborhood, and a map format so that patterns across the city can be found.

    <h1>Visualization</h1>
    
    <p><em>Include the interactive visualization as part of this page. Static example follows.</em></p>
    
  </div>
  
  <!-- Your visualization here -->
  <div class="vis-holder">
    <!-- Change viewbox to whatever you want, e.g. "0 0 1000 6000" This determines your aspect ratio and coordinate system -->    
    <!-- Delete all the sample SVG code below after the viewbox to before the closing tag. Populate this part of the SVG with D3. -->

    <h1>Demo Video</h1>
    
    <p><em>Embedded MP4 demo video using the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag. For example, this screen recording Prof. Cody Dunne made of Mike Bostock's flexible transitions in D3 slide:</em></p>
    
    <video controls width="100%">
      <source src="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/shared/d3-flexible-transitions.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is
       a <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/shared/d3-flexible-transitions.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
    </video>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>Summary of task table.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and abstract tasks for domain problems.</em></p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
    Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
    Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>


    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>Short summary of work completed and areas for improvement/future-work.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>Expectation: Meaningfully wraps up project and has good future directions.</em></p>
